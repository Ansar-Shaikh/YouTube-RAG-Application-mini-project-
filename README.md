Description:
This project is an AI-powered YouTube RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that leverages advanced language models to extract, summarize, and interact with YouTube video content. The app allows users to input YouTube video links and receive concise summaries, key insights, and answers to queries about the video content.

Key Features:

Video Transcript Retrieval: Automatically fetches transcripts from YouTube videos, including auto-generated captions.

Intelligent Summarization: Generates concise summaries of video content using RAG methodology.

Question-Answering System: Users can ask specific questions about a video and get precise AI-generated responses.

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Python & AI Integration: Utilizes Python libraries like LangChain, Transformers, and vector databases for embeddings and efficient retrieval.

Scalable & Extensible: Can be easily integrated with other AI tools or extended to handle multiple video platforms.

Technologies Used:
Python, Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI/Google Gemini, YouTube Transcript API, ChromaDB

Use Case:
This application is perfect for content creators, researchers, and learners who want to quickly understand the essence of YouTube videos without watching the entire content.
